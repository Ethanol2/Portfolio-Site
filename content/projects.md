## VR Tutorial

**September 6, 2024**

I refactored the VR Vision tutorial in summer 2024, adding some new elements and removing others. The cannon was my idea, and with some workshopping, I implemented it as a demo for some of the interactions users will face. Another addition that I took the lead on is the tool system that drives the ratchet interaction. The tutorial is free to try on **ManageXR**.

## Projects I’ve Worked On

Some of the work I’ve done for game jams, clients, and past employers:

### Word Search (2022)

*(Images here, if applicable)*

A project I worked on for a client. The game generates a unique word search using a list of words, which can be imported at runtime.  
Features include rotated letters, toggling diagonals, backwards words, and scrambling the word list.

### Craft Wars (2019)

*(Images here, if applicable)*

Created in Unity for Ludum Dare (theme: running out of space). I handled all the art, developed the input system using a custom C++ XInput plugin, and created the UI.

A game jam effort from 2018—unfortunately, the main project has since been lost. I handled all the art, UI development, and enemy pathfinding.
