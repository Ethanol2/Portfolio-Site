Software Developer with 7 years of experience across interactive, real-time, and production applications. While I have a strong background in game and simulation development, I’ve been actively expanding my skill set in backend development,
databases, APIs, and system design to strengthen my overall engineering foundation. I’m motivated by continuous
improvement, enjoy learning new technologies, and am happy contributing in a wide range of development roles where strong
fundamentals, adaptability, and collaboration are valued.
