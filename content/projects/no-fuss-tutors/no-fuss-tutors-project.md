- AWS

### Intended Platforms
- Android
- IOS

## Overview

Project Moon Rock was an ambitious educational game that I was the sole Unity developer on. When I left the project it had gameplay for city building and management, a tutorial and cutscenes and a quiz system for players to earn rewards. Looking back on the development, I'm proud of a lot of the features that I created for the game, many of which are visible in the tutorial.

### Database Intergration
We used MongoDB and AWS for account management and cloud saving. AWS served as the middle-man with its cloud functions. Originally I tried using MongoDB's package for Unity but found it wasn't readily compatible with the target platforms.
