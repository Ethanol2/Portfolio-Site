## Overview

A project I was hired to do when I did freelance on Fiver. It's a word search game that allows users to add their own list of words. Each puzzle is generated randomly for a unique experience each time.

The client wanted the ability for users to import their own words into the game, plus various ways to increase the difficulty. The game supports toggling diagonal words, backwards words and even rotated letters, if you're feeling especially mean.
