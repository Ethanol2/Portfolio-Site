# Personal Projects - Craft Wars

![Craft Wars Banner](/images/projects/personal/craft-wars/craft-wars-banner-2.png)

#### Tech Stack
- Unity C#

#### Platforms
- Windows

## Overview

This project started as a Ludem Dare gamejam, the theme being "Running out of Space".

> Craft Wars is about players trying to destroy the tiles underneath the other players and make them fall off the arena. The last player standing wins the match.

## Game Features
- Local multiplayer
- Multiple Game Modes

## My Role
I served as the artist and UI developer on this project. All assets, 3D and 2D, were created by me.

I also contributed where I was needed to the gameplay and input development.

## Media

Somehow I can't find any standalone video files that demo the game properly. Some footage has been used to make this personal trailer from 2020. 0:39 to 1:09.
