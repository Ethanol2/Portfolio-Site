## Overview

A basic snake game created with the game engine Godot. As a Unity developer it was an interesting (and challenging) experience creating my first project in the relatively new engine. I wanted to create something simple to soften the learning curve, and I'm very glad I did!

## Game Features
- Basic snake gameplay. You start as a dot and grow as you collect the targets. If you collide with your tail its game over.
- Grid, speed and edge wrapping are configurable with multiple options. Each set of options tracks scores indepentally.
- Sound effects
- Music
  - Music becomes more intense the closer the player is to the target
  - Can be disabled
- Save System
  - Saves the last ruleset used.
  - Saves the music enabled setting
