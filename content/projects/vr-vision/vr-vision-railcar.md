# VR Vision - Railcar Inspection Training

@[VR Vision Railcar Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOtPLN9U_P4)

#### Tech Stack
- Unity C#
- Meta/Oculus VR

## Overview

This project was created as a demo for the company. Using a YouTube video as reference, I worked with a couple of the artists to create this short but impactful tutorial.

The module does a great job showcasing the abilities of VR Vision's basic SDK, with very few extras. I'm happy with the end result, its a good looking and feeling experience.
